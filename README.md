FullStacked provides a whole set of commands and utilities useful for the whole web app lifecycle :
 
**Commands**
 * [create](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fullstacked/create)
 * [build](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fullstacked/build)
 * [run](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fullstacked/run)
 * [watch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fullstacked/watch)
 * [deploy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fullstacked/deploy)
 * [backup (& restore)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fullstacked/backup)

**Utilities**
 * [gui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fullstacked/gui)
 * [ide](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fullstacked/ide)
 * [webapp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fullstacked/webapp)
 
## Usage
#### Requirements
* NodeJS `>= 18.x` [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
* Docker and Docker-Compose [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
 
#### Getting Started

1. Create a folder where you will develop your awesome web app
```shell
mkdir my-awesome-project
cd my-awesome-project
```
2. Init fullstacked with npm
```shell
npm init @fullstacked@latest
```
3. Startup you project locally!
```shell
npm start
```
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/) and start developing!

## Motivation
As many web developer, I have changed my toolset very often. We waste
so much time on configs and figuring out how to build and deploy web apps. FullStacked aims to skip
all the configuration phases to instead allow you to start developing as quickly as possible!

I also really like the iterative approach, so I look forward to implementing ways to help with 
sharing development environments for the purpose of testing and reviewing.

## Roadmap & Thoughts

* Manage to create a simple and efficient way to test frontend component/class individually
* ~~Switch to~~ Support [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno) and/or [bun](https://github.com/Jarred-Sumner/bun)  
<br /> 
 
> These are being implemented in [FullStacked IDE](https://ide.fullstacked.org) or the GUI

* Add integration with [PWABuilder](https://github.com/pwa-builder/PWABuilder) to generate iOS and Android App
* <s>Switch nginx image for [nginx proxy manager](https://github.com/NginxProxyManager/nginx-proxy-manager) </s> 
Will create our own interface with [Tabler](https://github.com/tabler/tabler)
* TypeScript Web Based IDE using [monaco editor](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor)
  * Designed only for TypeScript projects, so it helps with all the main features
    * Typing
    * Autocomplete
    * Imports resolving
  * It must be enabled with PWA features, so that it feels like a native app
  * My goal would be to develop from anywhere (tablet or desktop) with all the same feature popular IDE provide.
